    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>The great rivers of Colorado are becoming less and less popular over time. 
    Unfortunately we are seeing a change in the activity levels of people. The invention of
    bolth the computer and the iphone tends to keep people occupied indoors. The purpose of this 
    site is to inspire people to get back out into the world and enjoy those rampaging rivers once again.</p>

    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p>In the building of this site we want to appeal to audiences old and young. Those who are new
        to the sport and those who have not visited it in quite some time. Of course we will want to target
        people with enough money to invest in the hobby, so households and athletes would make the most sense as a target audience. 
        Maybe middle class individusls. Our content should be family oriented, showing happy smiles and joy of being outside. 
        I think beautiful landscapes would appeal well, as well as a energetic color pallet. I expect the audience to normally
        use a desktop or laptop to access the site, but we shouldnt exclude mobile compatability.</p>

Follow the instructions on the activity in Canvas then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

    <!-- Copy and paste the URL to your finished palette below. Replace the href value that is there with yours. Make sure to paste it into both the href value and the content text of the <a> tag -->
