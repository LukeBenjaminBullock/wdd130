                <p>
                    I wish that I could spend all of my waking hours, maticulously perfecting all the arts
                    for which I have an interest. Unfortunately that simply isnt possible. Artists by and large
                    dont make enough money to get by, and I have no way of telling if I am one of the lucky ones. 
                    So my plan for life will be to go to school, work hard at my profession. And then hopefully make 
                    enough money to not ony be an artist, but one that is not starving.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Here on the home page I will introduce you to the more physical side of my artistic talents. 
                    Sclupting and costume crafting. I think it will be here that you will see manifest the most dedication I
                    am likely to put into my work.

                    necisarally the best in the class, but I did make a lot of containers, and I could 
                    make them big. Here are a few of my remaining works. </p>

                <p>My biggest pride an joy is my scale mail vest. This project took over 300 hours to complete, and included me
                    cutting out small scales out of plates of aluminum. Hole punching them, bending them, spray painting them, 
                    and weaving them together out of a spool of wire I found in the art room. 
                    I could be seen all throughout the second half of my Grade 12 year with the supplies for the costume, weaving in class, 
                    over lunch break, seminary, social events, everywhere.</p>

                <p>I am looking forwards to being involved in projects like these again sometime. A hard part about being out of school is that I have to 
                    pay for everything I build. But I dont think anything you enjoy is waisted. 
                    I think for my next armored chestplate I'm going to go red and black.</p>
