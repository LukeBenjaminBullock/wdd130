                    Ever since I first got the opportunity to sing, I loved the way it made your whole body feel. 
                    Almost like you lighting up inside. And being on stage is a wonderful thing. Like my drama teacher said 
                    its called a "play" for a reason. 
                    I have been in three big roles up until this point.

                <p> Mathew cutbert is a kind shy old gentleman. In the first few scenes of the play he has requested a boy 
                    for adoption so that they might be able to help on the farm. Instead the girl, Anne
                    (Spelled with an e) is waiting there at the train station. Mr. Cutbert is instantly drawn into the 
                    fantastical world of fantasy that the girl has created. And asks Marilla that they might be able to keep the child. 
                    Despite the old woman's protests the girl gets to stay, and green gables is never the same again.

                <p id="acting-subtext-two">From Peter pan and the star catcher.</p>
                <p> When Fruin the drama teacher was giving out roles for the play Peter pan and the starcatcher. He warned 
                    those aditioning that there really wasn't any such thing as a main role in the play. That is there were no
                    main roles other than captain stache. This character is a rather energetic and comical younger version of 
                    captain hook, and to play him well re quires a massive amount of energy, not to mention memorizing a small book. 
                    I remember running around the stage screaming in fear, face turning red with pain, and delivering long flowing 
                    nonsensacle monologues to the audience. All in all this character was a blast, and I'm not sure Ill ever be able 
                    to play something quite so exilerating.

                <p id="acting-subtext-three">From The lamp lighter</p>
                <p> Out of all the characters I've played, this one certainetly has the darkest soul. One of the characters in the 
                    play has the tragic backstory of having had lord strout as his uncle. With this in mind, the sinister lord represents
                    true darkness in the play. He is the absence of love and hates the concept with a burning passion. Beliving that the 
                    only true powers in the world are the primal instics that drive human behavior. Insticts such as Lust and fear. This is also the 
                    only costume where I supplied the whole peice. How do you like the black and red suit?
