      <h3>Handcrafts</h3>
      <p>
        I wish that I could spend all of my waking hours, maticulously perfecting all the arts
        for which I have an interest. Unfortunately that simply isnt possible. Artists by and large
        dont make enough money to get by, and I have no way of telling if I am one of the lucky ones. 
        So my plan for life will be to go to school, work hard at my profession. And then hopefully make 
        enough money to not ony be an artist, but one that is not starving. 

        Here on the home page I will introduce you to the more physical side of my artistic talents. 
        Sclupting and costume crafting. I think it will be here that you will see manifest the most dedication I
        am likely to put into my work. 

        At the age of 8 I was introduced to sculpting. (Show mask)

        And I continued on in a couple of pottery classes till the age of 13. I wasnt
        necisarally the best in the class, but I did make a lot of containers, and I could 
        make them big. Here are a few of my remaining works. (Show pots)

        My biggest pride an joy is my scale mail vest. This project took over 300 hours to complete, and included me
        cutting out small scales out of plates of aluminum. Hole punching them, bending them, spray painting them, 
        and weaving them together out of a spool of wire I found in the art room. 
        I could be seen all throughout the second half of my Grade 12 year with the supplies for the costume, weaving in class, 
        over lunch break, seminary, social events, everywhere. (Show partial vest)

        I was able to submit my armor to a compitition where I won 100$ in a catigory that had never existed before. (Show armor on display)

        Though its original purpose was to be a part of a costume, the rest of the costume of which took under 50 hours to make. (Show maheegan)

        And of course when I found two maniquins for sale I bought them, the second maniquin is going to be for my next project. (Show maniquins)

        I am looking forwards to being involved in projects like these again sometime. A hard part about being out of school is that I have to 
        pay for everything I build. But I dont think anything you enjoy is waisted. 
        I think for my next armored chestplate I'm going to go red and black.

      <h3>Acting</h3>
      <p>
        Ever since I first got the opportunity to sing, I loved the way it made your whole body feel. 
        Almost like you lighting up inside. And being on stage is a wonderful thing. Like my drama teacher said 
        its called a "play" for a reason. 
        I have been in three big roles up until this point. 

        Mathew Cutbert - Played role at Age 16 
        From Anne of Gree gables. 
        Mathew cutbert is a kind shy old gentleman. In the first few scenes of the play he has requested a boy 
        for adoption so that they might be able to help on the farm. Instead the girl, Anne
        (Spelled with an e) is waiting there at the train station. Mr. Cutbert is instantly drawn into the 
        fantastical world of fantasy that the girl has created. And asks Marilla that they might be able to keep the child. 
        Despite the old woman's protests the girl gets to stay, and green gables is never the same again. 
        
        Captain stache - Played role at age 18 
        From Peter pan and the star catcher. 
        When Fruin the drama teacher was giving out roles for the play Peter pan and the starcatcher. He warned 
        those aditioning that there really wasn't any such thing as a main role in the play. That is there were no
        main roles other than captain stache. This character is a rather energetic and comical younger version of 
        captain hook, and to play him well re quires a massive amount of energy, not to mention memorizing a small book. 
        I remember running around the stage screaming in fear, face turning red with pain, and delivering long flowing 
        nonsensacle monologues to the audience. All in all this character was a blast, and I'm not sure Ill ever be able 
        to play something quite so exilerating. 

        Lord strout - Played at age 21 
        From The lamp lighter
        Out of all the characters I've played, this one certainetly has the darkest soul. One of the characters in the 
        play has the tragic backstory of having had lord strout as his uncle. With this in mind, the sinister lord represents
        true darkness in the play. He is the absence of love and hates the concept with a burning passion. Beliving that the 
        only true powers in the world are the primal instics that drive human behavior. Insticts such as Lust and fear. This is also the 
        only costume where I supplied the whole peice. How do you like the black and red suit?

      <h3>Writing</h3>
      <p>
        Writing is really the art form that I have been participating in the longest. My first 
        book was written at the age of 8, being called the door of doors. 
        
        I would like to imagine that the only real thing that got me through enlish in school was my 
        affinity for writing great short stories. 
        
        In grade 9 we had a unit that revolved around poetry, and I was ablle to dabble a little bit in the art. 
        The peice below is my favorite project. 

        At the age of 11 or twelve I started my greatest unfinished peice of writing. This was to be a three book serise
        I figure that it is best to write them up all at once and release them one at a time. I have More than 300 pages 
        of the book written up between several documents. All at varying degrees of quality. 
        
        For the last couple of years I have put down the book entirely. After years of writing I have gotten tired of this one 
        singular story. I still want to write, but I would like to look at something new. I have many mediums as of yet untried 
        screenplays, playwrites, videogame storylines, etc. I think it would be fun to branch out somewhat. 

        Below are some of my favorite bits of story. (Show story slide)
